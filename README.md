Fork for [Tuya local](https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local) without resrictions and rules of "kings"

This is a Home Assistant integration to support devices running Tuya
firmware without going via the Tuya cloud.  Devices are supported
over WiFi, limited support for devices connected via hubs is available.

Note that many Tuya devices seem to support only one local connection.
If you have connection issues when using this integration, ensure that
other integrations offering local Tuya connections are not configured
to use the same device, mobile applications on devices on the local
network are closed, and no other software is trying to connect locally
to your Tuya devices.

Using this integration does not stop your devices from sending status
to the Tuya cloud, so this should not be seen as a security measure,
rather it improves speed and reliability by using local connections,
and may unlock some features of your device, or even unlock whole
devices, that are not supported by the Tuya cloud API.
